# component-shim
a simple component shim, using custom element

## about custom-element-shim
Yes, it support IE8! But using IE8 means loading more files and trick coding.
I just leave it here.

## about shadowDOM-shim
shadowDOM is only for CHROME, so many browsers do not support it, so I've decided to use template engine to do rendering work.
the engine currently is [etpl](https://github.com/ecomfe/etpl)
